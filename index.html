                <p>Hi, I'm Chloe Muggeridge and I have developed this website to explain a little about myself as I am looking for work experience in July 2019.

                <p>I am intreseted in new technologies and currently studying Computer Science as one of my GCSEs. Other subjects I enjoy include Science, Maths and Art. 
                    I have included some examples of my art work below.</p>
                
                <p> I am fascinated by the vast capabilities of the computers and new technologies, plus the ability to use this capability to create amazing graphics. I believe that the future will
                    will revolve round the use of computers and I want to be part of it.</p>
                    
                <p>I now want to use my work experience opportuntiy to understand more about the IT/Technology industry</p>

                    please get in touch with me. My contact details are below.</p>

                    <p> I am a hardworking GCSE student with the ambition to have a sucessful and rewarding career within the technology sector. This interest in this sector
                        is based on a love of problem solving, the ability to create something new, the need for ongoing learning and have the opportunity to be creative.</p>
                        
                    <p>Currently studying for 9 GCSEs including art, computer science, separate science's and French. I enjoy science the most as it is logical and has 
                        certain rules it must follow to work. Also I enjoy Art as it provides the freedom to create something without any boundaries. I have sucessfully moved 
                        from the middle sets ability classes to the top sets in all subjects this year by working hard and efficiently.</p>
                          
                    <p>Outside school interests include Rugby, Teaching Swimming, Badminton, Tennis and Sailing. A section below provides further information. </p>
